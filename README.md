Some ideas from a non-developer for developers on what technologies improve the user experience on Linux

1. Self-extractable compressed tar archive with Installer like as [mojosetup](https://github.com/icculus/mojosetup). Software that implements this concept: [NVIDIA drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/Download/driverResults.aspx/193095/en-us/), [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve)
2. Single binary-file for Linux on container like as AppImage, but with full integrate, and works glibc-free distros
3. Using declarative files for installation. Example: [rinstall](https://github.com/danyspin97/rinstall), [One Click Install](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:One_Click_Install) by openSUSE
