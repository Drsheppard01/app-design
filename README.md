# Some ideas from a non-developer for developers on what technologies improve the user experience on Linux

1. You need a `single file format` that `will integrate into the desktop and menu` with one click using a handler
2. You need a `file format` that will `add a new repository` with one click handler
3. A `graphical client` to `install the programs` packed in the file described in [step 1](https://github.com/Drsheppard01/app-design/edit/main/README.md#L3), and which will automatically add a new repository as described in [step 2](https://github.com/Drsheppard01/app-design/edit/main/README.md#L4)
